# Intel-Scene-Image-Classification-Challenge
This the notebook which i coded during my participation in Intel Scene Image Classification Challenge
I had used the following architecture
Conv->Conv->Pool->Conv->Conv->Pool->Conv->Conv->Conv->Pool->Conv->Conv->Conv->Pool->Flatten->Dense->Dropout->Dense

And used image augmentation in order to increse the dataset and got accuracy of about 89% on their test set
